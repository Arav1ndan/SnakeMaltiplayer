# SnakeMaltiplayer

Snake Multiplayer is a simple yet engaging multiplayer version of the classic Snake game, designed to showcase my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and adherence to SOLID design principles in game development.

Features

Single Player & Multiplayer Modes – Play solo or compete against others in real-time.

Smooth Gameplay Mechanics – Implemented using Unity's physics system for a fluid experience.

Scalable Architecture – Designed with OOP and SOLID principles to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

Multiple Item Types – Various collectible items affect gameplay, adding variety and challenge.

Customizable Player Details – A separate scene for player input before transitioning into the game.

Optimized Multiplayer Logic – Multiplayer functionality built without using Photon PUN, utilizing a custom networking solution instead.

Technologies Used

Unity – Game engine for development.

C# – Primary programming language.

Custom Multiplayer Networking – Implemented without Photon PUN, using a unique networking approach.

Why I Built This

This project serves as a demonstration of my game development skills and understanding of multiplayer networking. It highlights my ability to write clean, modular, and maintainable code while following industry-standard design patterns.
